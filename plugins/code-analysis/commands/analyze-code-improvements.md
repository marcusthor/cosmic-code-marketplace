# Code Improvements Analysis

I'll analyze the codebase for improvement opportunities by discovering existing patterns and suggesting extensions.

## Step 1: Run Analysis

Using the **code-improvements** skill to analyze:
- Existing patterns (components, routes, utilities, hooks)
- Extension opportunities across 7 categories
- Reusable architecture patterns

## Step 2: Create Improvement Tickets

After analysis, I'll:
1. Create `improvements/code-improvements/` directory in your project
2. Generate individual ticket files for each improvement
3. Format: `NNN-short-title.md` (e.g., `001-add-product-filter-component.md`)
4. Each ticket contains:
   - Title and description
   - Category and effort estimate
   - Affected files
   - Implementation steps
   - Code examples

You can then:
- Review tickets and prioritize
- Use individual tickets as implementation tasks
- Reference tickets when implementing improvements

**Let me start the analysis...**
